size: Wingspan 4 to 6 inches (100-150mm).
host: Citrus trees (e.g., orange, lemon), prickly ash, and hoptree.
interestingFactsOne: The Eastern Giant Swallowtail is often called the "Orange Dog" because its caterpillar resembles bird droppings, a clever camouflage to avoid predators.
interestingFactsTwo: This species is known for its powerful and fast flight, often seen darting between flowers or trees.
interestingFactsThree: The caterpillars of the Eastern Giant Swallowtail are considered pests in citrus orchards due to their feeding habits.
migration: The Eastern Giant Swallowtail does not migrate long distances but may move locally in response to seasonal changes or food availability.
distribution: Found throughout the eastern United States, southern Canada, and as far south as Central America.
flightSpeed: Fast and agile, making it difficult to catch or photograph.
conservationStatus: The Eastern Giant Swallowtail is not currently considered endangered or threatened.
culturalSignificance: This butterfly is celebrated for its size and beauty, often featured in butterfly gardens and educational programs.
predatorsAndThreats: Birds, spiders, and wasps are common predators. The caterpillar's bird-dropping mimicry helps protect it from predators, but it remains vulnerable during its early stages.

<h3 id='lifecycle'>Lifecycle</h3>

<h3 id="egg">Egg</h3>
<p style={{maxWidth: "700px"}}>The Eastern Giant Swallowtail begins its life as a tiny, spherical egg laid on the leaves of host plants like citrus trees. The eggs are pale yellow and darken as they near hatching, which typically occurs within 4 to 10 days.</p>

<h3 id="caterpillar">Caterpillar</h3>
<p style={{maxWidth: "800px"}}>The caterpillar of the Eastern Giant Swallowtail is one of the most unique in the butterfly world. It resembles bird droppings, a form of camouflage that helps it avoid predators. The caterpillar goes through five instar stages, growing larger and more distinct with each molt.</p>
<div className= "flex wrap" >
<div className="col-6">
<h4>First Instar:</h4>
<p>After hatching, the first instar caterpillar is small and dark, resembling a tiny bird dropping. It feeds on the leaves of its host plant and grows rapidly. Lasts for about 3-4 days.</p>
</div>
<div className="col-6">
<h4>Second Instar:</h4>
<p>In the second instar, the caterpillar develops more pronounced markings and begins to resemble bird droppings even more closely. Lasts for about 3-4 days.</p>
</div>

<div className= "col-6">
<h4>Third Instar:</h4>
<p>By the third instar, the caterpillar has grown significantly and its camouflage becomes even more effective. It continues to feed voraciously. Lasts for about 3-4 days.</p>
</div>
<div className= "col-6">
<h4>Fourth Instar:</h4>
<p>In the fourth instar, the caterpillar's size increases further, and its markings become more distinct. It prepares for the final instar stage. Lasts for about 3-4 days.</p>
</div>
<div >
<h4>Fifth Instar:</h4>
<p>This is the final stage before pupation. The caterpillar reaches its maximum size, often exceeding 2 inches in length. It then seeks a sheltered spot to form its chrysalis. Lasts for about 4-5 days.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="Chrysalis">Formation of the Chrysalis</h3>
<p>After the fifth instar, the caterpillar attaches itself to a sturdy surface using a silk pad. It forms a chrysalis that resembles a piece of wood or bark, providing excellent camouflage. The chrysalis stage lasts for about 10 to 20 days, depending on environmental conditions.</p>

<h4>What does the Eastern Giant Swallowtail Chrysalis look like?</h4>
<p>The chrysalis is brown and resembles a broken twig or piece of bark, blending seamlessly with its surroundings. This camouflage helps protect it from predators.</p>

<h4>How long does the Eastern Giant Swallowtail stay in the Chrysalis?</h4>
<p>The butterfly remains in the chrysalis for approximately <strong>10 to 20 days</strong>, depending on temperature and humidity.</p>

<h3>Adult Behavior</h3>

<h4>Lifespan</h4>
<p>The adult Eastern Giant Swallowtail lives for about 1 to 2 months, depending on environmental conditions and predation.</p>

<h4>Feeding</h4>
<p>Adults feed on nectar from a variety of flowers, including milkweed, thistles, and lantana. They are also known to visit mud puddles to absorb minerals.</p>

<h4 >Mating and Reproduction</h4>
<p>Males patrol for females, often near host plants. After mating, females lay eggs singly on the leaves of host plants. The eggs hatch within a week, and the cycle begins anew.</p>

<h4>How to tell Male from Female</h4>
<p>Males and females are similar in appearance, but females tend to be slightly larger with broader wings.</p>

<h4>Migration</h4>
<p>The Eastern Giant Swallowtail does not migrate long distances but may move locally in response to seasonal changes.</p>
